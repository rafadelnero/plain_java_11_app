Plain Java Project with Gradle and Java 11


- Start with config
- Simple Java class that accepts a Collection of Address - can be the constructor 


- URLs should be unique, 
- It should not be possible to register the same address two times

multiple times, should return one backend-instance choosing 
between the registered ones randomly.
